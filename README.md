This README is for my application website for Founders and Coders!

## Ideas

I'll try to put some of my ideas for my website here broken down into different sections.

### Style

I'm going for an old school computer-y look. Everything will be green and black with "scanlines" on top of everything. Something like this:

<img src="https://oldcraporg.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dsc_0089.jpeg" alt="An old computer with a green display."/>

<img src="https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2015/usgamer/f4_lock_01.jpg" alt="A screenshot from the video game Fallout 4 showing a black computer screen with green text on it."/>

I've created a card for my stream using Photoshop in this style and I want to recreate that look using CSS:

All images displayed on the page will be green and black. I can use CSS to achieve this.


### Layout

I wanted to go for a vertical menu bar similar to that found in Alien: Isolation where selecting the menu item on the left changes the content on the right:

<img src="https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_uk/photo/a/alien-isol/alien-isolation-for-pc-old-computer_gvnd.1024.jpg" alt="A screenshot from the video game Alien: Isolation showing a green computer screen with white text on it."/>

The content on the right will be scrollable so that you always have the menu bar and border fixed on screen.

### Content

There will be 4 main pages: a landing/home page, a bit about me and why I want to apply, a MTG life total app and a image carousel for my cats, Felt <img src="https://bit.ly/39Jb6o2" alt="A small picture of a black and white kitten's face mid yawn making it look like they are screaming."> and Noodle <img src="https://bit.ly/3tr02nI" alt="A small picture of a white kitten's face mid yawn making it look like they are screaming.">.

### Functionality

#### Menu

I'd like the menu to work so that when you click on a menu item it changes what is in the content view but without changing the URL. [This W3Schools How TO](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_vertical_tabs.asp) should help me achieve this.

#### MTG Life App

This will be a basic life counter for Magic: The Gathering that I should be able to use when I play to track life totals of up to 4 players.

I'd like to be able to start by selecting how many players and then have separate life totals displayed on the page and then select the starting life total.

You'll be able to increase and decrease the life of each player in increments of 1 or 5.

#### Cats Image Carousel

This will be a slideshow of pictures of my cats! It will automatically cycle through the images and there will be controls to stop the slideshow and progress backwards and forwards.

I can use [this W3Schools How TO](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) and [Gregor's recent live coding session](https://discord.com/channels/819243160893915167/839864574936219648/842759893680914442) to help me build this.

## To Do

Here's a list of stuff I need to do!

- [x] Create the HTML, CSS and JS files.
- [ ] Import and adapt my HTML and CSS from [this repo where I was working on it before](https://github.com/lopezelpesado/old-website).
- [x] Build the menu system.
