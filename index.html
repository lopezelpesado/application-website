                <p>I am Alex Lopez (AKA lopezelpesado) and this is my application website for Founders and Coders. Here’s <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/lopezelpesado" target="_blank">my freeCodeCamp profile</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/lopezelpesado" target="_blank">my Codewars profile</a>. And that’s me above!</p>

                <p>This is the HOME page!</p>

                <p>The ABOUT page has a bit about why I am applying to Founders and Coders.</p>

                <p>The MAGIC page has a life counting app for the collectible card game <a href="https://youtu.be/w0lMcAdXopg" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> (MTG). In MTG, your life total is an important element of the game and can go up and down from turn to turn. When your life goes to 0, you lose! So it’s vital that you keep track of how much life you and your opponents have left. This app will help you do just that.</p>

                <p>The CATS page, surprisingly, has some pictures of my cats. Please be aware that the content of this section has extremely high levels of cuteness.</p>

                <p>Check out the code that I hope you’re enjoying right now over on <a href="https://github.com/lopezelpesado/application-website" target="_blank">website’s GitHub repository</a>!</p>

                    <h1>WHY I AM APPLYING TO FOUNDERS AND CODERS</h1>

                    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in all things technological but I never learnt to code. After I left my job at the end of last year and had a bit of a break, I decided that I wanted to use this opportunity to finally learn to code.</p>
                        
                    <p>I decided to learn to code because I want to build things that people use, enjoy and that help them. I want to build things that I can be proud of. I want to work with people to help solve problems for others. I have seen how tech designed to help others can have such a positive impact in people's lives and I want to be a part of that. I see learning to code and becoming a developer as a way to achieve this.</p>

                    <p>Since starting my learning journey at the end of last year, I have found that coding appeals to me on so many levels. I love problem solving and I feel that it is something I am good at. It’s a skill that I’ve been able to use throughout learning to code, especially through learning JavaScript. I find it so satisfying figuring out solutions to problems. I had a vision for what I wanted this website to look like and realising that vision with HTML and CSS felt amazing. I’m really proud of what I’ve made.</p>

                    <p>The Founders and Coders Coaching Programme has helped me in my learning so much. The environment that was created on the programme allowed me to learn from others on the same journey as me and to help others learn. This was invaluable. It exposed me to new ideas, methods and ways of approaching problems. It also introduced me to a diverse group of people who were all united in the goal of learning to code. It felt great to be a part of this group and I hope my input enhanced others' learning as much as theirs did mine. Founders and Coders' collaborative and peer-led approach to learning is particularly well suited to me and how I learn best.</p>

                    <p>I love working and learning with other people. Working with others towards a common goal as part of a team is a very rewarding experience for me. I find that explaining concepts that are new to me to other people is one of the best ways I cement my learning. I love listening to and learning from other people’s experiences and ideas. I want to be a part of building a better, more diverse and inclusive tech industry and I believe Founders and Coders will enable me to do so.</p>
