                <p>I am Alex Lopez (AKA lopezelpesado) and this is my application website for Founders and Coders. Here’s <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/lopezelpesado" target="_blank">my freeCodeCamp profile</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/lopezelpesado" target="_blank">my Codewars profile</a>. And that’s me above!</p>
                
                <p id="pButtonLocMob">The buttons at the bottom will take you to the different parts of my website.</p>

                <p id="pButtonLocDesk">The buttons on the left will take you to the different parts of my website.</p>

                <p>This is the HOME page!</p>

                <p>The ABOUT page has a bit about why I am applying to Founders and Coders.</p>

                <p>The MAGIC page has a life counting app for the collectible card game <a href="https://youtu.be/w0lMcAdXopg" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> (MTG). In MTG, your life total is an important element of the game and can go up and down from turn to turn. When your life goes to 0, you lose! So it’s vital that you keep track of how much life you and your opponents have left. This app will help you do just that.</p>

                <p>The CATS page, surprisingly, has some pictures of my cats. Please be aware that the content of this section has extremely high levels of cuteness.</p>

                <p>Check out the code that I hope you’re enjoying right now over on <a href="https://github.com/lopezelpesado/application-website" target="_blank">website’s GitHub repository</a>!</p>

                <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.</p>
